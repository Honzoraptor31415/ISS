## ISS api calls with Python
## [![](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py)](/)

A simple Python app with Tkinter, that uses some JSON apis to get interesting data about ISS including it's current position, and then displays it in the GUI window.

<br />

I already made a similar thing using HTML and vanilla Javascript, so I have some experience with these apis and with displaying an image of the ISS based on the data that I get from the api.
